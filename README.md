# 3d-Platform-Java-Game
This was the final project for my intermediate computer science class and was a 3d platform based game. The user controls a rotating 3d cube and collects gold cubes while avoiding blue spheres and holes in the ground. There is a portal that appears later which jumps the user forward.

This project was coded in Java using Processing and employs Object Orientated Programming, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and interfaces.
